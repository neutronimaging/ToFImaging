This package contains python functions for the fitting of phase transformation of Bragg attenuation patterns.
This assumes the measured linear attenuation coefficient μ, is a linear combination of a phases with a given a-priori reference linear attenuation coefficients φ

Currently implemented are the solvers for the 2 phases case and 3 phases case.

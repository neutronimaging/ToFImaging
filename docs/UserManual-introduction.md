Assessing the quality of the imaging performance is of high importance for quantitative imaging experiments. 

The procedures described here are a follow-up from the IAEA round robin project in 2014 where resolution and contrast was targeted. The experiences from that project showed that a revised set of test objects are needed. 

In this report, we will present new samples to determine the resolution of radiographs and tomograms. The former CT contrast object has also been revised. The procedures described in this report are based in the publications (Kaestner, et al., 2013) and (Kaestner, et al., 2017).
